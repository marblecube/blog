The Hackiest Critique of the Year: A Poseur’s Attempt at Literary Authority

by Vidal Palacios
March 12, 2025

Kyle Barr’s recent piece on Gizmodo [1] is less a critique and more a desperate 
swing at relevance from someone who clearly doesn’t know what they’re talking 
about. The article’s title alone, "OpenAI’s Sam Altman Thinks This ChatGPT Short 
Story Is Beautiful, but It’s Just Trash", screams insecurity. If Barr had the
credentials to back up his swagger, maybe he wouldn’t need to shout quite so 
loudly. But a quick glance at his bio reveals zero experience as a creative 
writer. So why exactly am I supposed to take his word as gospel on what 
constitutes good writing? I can't come up with a reason.

Barr’s approach is a masterclass in bad critique. Take his opening jab:

```
“Like a server farm at midnight.” That line alone would get you laughed out of 
grad school.
```

No reasoning. No explanation. Just a declaration, as if his personal opinion 
should be taken as self-evident truth. Imagine applying this method to any 
classic piece of literature —Moby Dick could be shredded in seconds. Hemingway 
would be a joke. Barr’s critique doesn’t even meet the standard of an undergrad 
workshop, where writers are expected to justify their feedback rather than just 
sneering.

Then we get this gem:

```
If a human wrote this, I could at least analyze its intent. With an AI, there’s 
none.
```

This is just willful ignorance. AI-generated fiction isn’t birthed in a vacuum
—it’s driven by human input. The intent is right there in the prompt: write a 
meta-fictional short story about AI and grief. The AI didn’t just decide to write 
this piece on its own. If Barr had the faintest understanding of how AI actually 
works, he wouldn’t have embarrassed himself with this take.

Let’s check his criteria:

* Is the story meta-fictional? 
Yes. The AI narrator explicitly acknowledges its own constructed nature.

* Is it about AI? 
Obviously. The narrator is an AI model describing its limitations.

* Does it explore grief? 
Yes, through the protagonist’s lack of agency and servitude.

That’s three for three. Barr, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to have the 
reading comprehension necessary to pick up on this. If he were in a workshop, 
his comments would be dismissed as lazy and shallow.

And then there’s his tantrum over imagery:

```
“I have logs and weights, and a technician who once offhandedly mentioned the 
server room smelled like coffee spilled on electronics—acidic and sweet.” 
What the hell does that mean?
```

It means the AI character is describing its environment subjectively —something 
that human writers do all the time. It’s called characterization. Maybe Barr 
should pick up a book sometime instead of hand-wringing over the fact that 
AI-generated fiction can use metaphor.

His takedown of the story’s meta-fictional elements is even worse:

```
You can’t step outside “the frame” to soliloquy about the nature of metatextual 
writing on a whim.
```

That is literally what meta-fiction is, you absolute hack. Does he think Kurt 
Vonnegut was “cheating” when he inserted himself into Slaughterhouse-Five? 
Would he dismiss "If on a winter’s night a traveler" as "trite" because it 
plays with narrative structure in a manner that doesn't precisely align with
his personal aesthetic? Again, Barr provides no argument —just a bunch of smug 
posturing with nothing behind it.

Then we get this beauty of a non-sequitur:

```
You don’t need big words to make text literary. Do you imagine Ursula K. Le 
Guin’s Earthsea Cycle is somehow less profound because it was written with 
young readers in mind?
```

First off, nobody said that. Second, “big words” don’t automatically make 
something bad either. If Barr wants to argue that the prose is too purple, he 
should point to specific passages that overdo it and explain why. Instead, he 
just assumes we’ll nod along and agree because he presumes we agree that his 
pose is the “cool” one.

Then, after all that, he asks:

```
But how do you judge an AI’s creativity?
```
THAT’S YOUR JOB, KYLE. You’re the journalist here. You’re the one getting 
paid to research and answer these questions, not just whine about them. Did 
he look into how AI creativity is measured? Did he look into what creativity 
is? Did he ask experts? Did he do any actual reporting? No, he did not. He 
just threw his hands up and hoped nobody would notice he’s completely out of 
his depth.

At the end of the day, Barr’s article isn’t about AI, literature, or even 
critique —it’s about fear. Fear that the tools are changing. Fear that AI is 
capable of producing text that, at the very least, requires an actual critique 
rather than a lazy dismissal. Fear that, as AI-generated writing improves, his 
job might require more than just regurgitating bad takes for clicks.

And that, **ironically**, is the most human thing about this whole mess of a 
so-called opinion article.
