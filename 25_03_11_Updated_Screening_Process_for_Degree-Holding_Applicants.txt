Subject: Updated Screening Process for Degree-Holding Applicants

Team,

As we continue to refine our hiring process, we must remain vigilant
in selecting candidates who can prove their value through action and
results, not just credentials. It has become increasingly clear that
college degrees are not an indicator of intelligence, ability, or 
initiative —in fact, in many cases, they are simply a sign that 
someone followed the default path rather than forging their own.

Going forward, when interviewing applicants who do hold degrees, we
need to assess why they took the long, expensive route instead of
proving their skills on their own—like actual and not pretend men.
Additionally, we are now encountering a new hiring challenge: 
People have begun lying about NOT going to college to better fit
into modern, skills-based workplaces.

Naturally, we have recently encountered applicants concealing their
college attendance to avoid the stigma of relying on a degree.

Be sure to really probe the backgrounds of anyone showing 
unexplained gaps of 2-8 years (particularly 4) to prevent this.


Screening Questions for Degree Holders:

1. “Why did you feel you needed college to succeed?”

2. “Could you not figure out how to learn on your own?”

3. “What did college give you that YouTube, books, and hands-on 
work couldn’t?”

4. “Did you go to college because you had no other options?”

5. “Did you need external structure to stay disciplined, or do
you naturally push yourself?”

6. “How much of what you learned in college do you actually
use in real life?”

7. “If your college degree was removed from your resume, what
would you bring to the table?”

8. “Do you think employers should prioritize practical experience
over classroom learning? Why or why not?”

9. “Have you ever worked with someone without a degree who 
outperformed you? What did you learn from that experience?”

10. “If degrees weren’t required for jobs, would you have still
gone to college?”

11. “We’ve noticed an increasing trend of applicants lying about
NOT attending college. Can you confirm, under penalty of
termination, that you have never attended university?”

This isn’t about disqualifying degree holders, but we should be
highly skeptical of those who relied on a credential instead of
demonstrating real initiative. We want people who took control of
their own growth, not those who followed the beaten path out of
fear or laziness.

Let’s make sure we’re building a team of doers, not just diploma collectors.

P.S. I will be off-grid for the next two weeks on a big game hunting
expedition and may be out of range for calls. However, I will check in via
satellite phone periodically to ensure this policy is implemented properly.
In my absence, do not allow any credentialist weakness to creep into our
hiring practices.
