THE SAME LETTERS that spell heart can also spell hater. 

I didn’t know that until I was walking down the street one day and saw a 
piece of paper on the ground that drew my attention. I picked it up and 
noticed it was a series of word jumbles with pictures over them. Underneath 
each puzzle were some kid’s guesses at a solution and, get this, instead of 
rearranging the letters they just rewrote the jumble. So, for example, 
there was this one picture of a boy and a girl hugging and underneath that
were the letters OVLE, and instead of solving as LOVE, the kid just wrote
OVLE again. 

The whole thing was like that. 

It was kind of funny and I imagined a parent looking at it, laughing, and
handing it back to the kid that had been hoping for a different reaction.
In my imagination, the kid has lost interest and throws it on the ground,
where it lays unnoticed, until I happen across it...calling to me...from
down in the dirt. 

Right now I’m sitting on the top level of a five-story, concrete parking
structure. 

I can see the mountains in the distance; slim blue and purple outlines
against a chalky gray sky. There are painted white stripes on the ground
and some thickly squeezed, yellow arrows. Square patterns of L.E.D. lights
on the ends of the lampposts and, atop a central pole, an array of antennas
and cameras. The cameras protected against the elements and 
counter-observation by shaded half-blisters of dark, smoked plastic. 

There is a white box with a partially unwound hose draped out of it. Its 
facing glass shattered inward. The word ‘FIRE’ is emblazoned across it in a
bold, red sans-serif. 

There is more broken glass on the ground around me, tiny shards too small
to be of any threat; dust, cigarette butts, crumpled napkins, the
occasional, abruptly abandoned half-blunt. 

Over there is the elevator, the shiny steel doors, the black number 5 on a
containing, yellow square next to them.

There’s something about the solidity of concrete along with its subtly
swirled, smoothed-over-and-left-to-dry patterns combined with cavernous,
empty spaces and complete lack of excess that soothes and comforts me. One
is forced to become contemplative when held within a sparse design and
exposed to the wind. It all seems very holy. 

Were I to stand and look to my left, I would see clear out past the
skyscrapers and to the ocean, behind me and to the right the sprawl of
suburbia goes on for as far as the eye is capable of seeing. 

But, I’m not standing up. 

I’m tired and I would rather sit and enjoy the blank, featureless, overcast
sky. 

Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy detailed, intricate, even baroque, forms of 
stimulation and design, but in the early morning when it is cold and I am
still waking up, I prefer the silent, the empty, and all that which is
lacking information, datum & excess. 

I don’t mind the crows though. 

All of us up here dressed in black, hanging out. Recently, I have begun to 
wonder if they have the necessary amount of cones in the backs of their
eyes to perceive that we are all of the same color or if their rods are
enough to determine the same thing, instead using scale and intensity. 

I’ll remember to look it up later. 

I did look up the different sounds that they make. Mostly there’s that 'caw
caw’ sound that everyone knows, but other times there are other calls.
There’s this one sound (I think it’s only the males) and it’s only the
bigger ones, and when they do it the feathers fringing their necks are
puffed out and rustled. I found some recordings that purported to identify
what each call signified and the one that I’m talking about was labeled as
“Alerting to Danger Nearby”. But, I don’t think that’s correct because I
see this one crow doing it all the time and nobody and nothing is nearby
that could be threatening it. No, I think it’s that it’s more like he’s
declaring his right to exist. If it were a statement in human English it
would be something like, “Hey all you other crows within earshot: I know I
am badass! There is danger nearby and you are feasting your eyes upon it
right now!” 

It’s got this wonderfully musical quality to it that makes it sound a bit
like the rattle of a snake slowed down and passed through a sound filter,
like one of those notched wooden fish from when I was in preschool that I
could run a stick across and get a single rhythmic tone except it’s a run 
of seven, only slightly, discordant sounds that repeat and repeat with 
intermittent pauses in between. Each one slow and thoughtful.

It takes a while for me to wake up because I never really fully sleep and
most of the time I wake up with a headache. Right now though, I have been
up for about an hour and am half way through my first cup of coffee and my
third or fourth cigarette, so the headache is mostly gone.
