IT IS UPON US

I’m outside of the local Starbucks smoking a cigarette while seated on this bench near this giant planter.
I’m facing the patio and it’s crowded and there’s this guy that’s nutty and pushes himself around in a wheelchair. He’s got these frosted tips and his skin is just burnt all to shit from being in the sun all the time, and he’s always wearing these stupid, fucking, Oakley sunglasses.
This dude rolls his fat ass up on the daily and you always know when he’s about to arrive because he begins shouting nonsense from blocks away. Sometimes if a car is too close he will lean over and bat in a mirror with one of his gloved hands. He sits for hours dancing between spoked wheels sweatily staring into the Void and mostly breathes through his mouth.
Anyway he’s there brooding and right next to him at this other table is this young Chinese couple. They’re sharing a drink and the young man has presented her with this Hello Kitty gift bag and it’s like Asian Norman Rockwell or something and, you know, it’s cute, but whatevs, I’m smoking a cigarette and kind of on my own trip because of the patty melt and this vape pen I just can’t stop hitting.
All of a sudden wheelchair squishy can’t contain himself anymore, he pivots around and faces them. They’re stunned. I can see that everyone is. Did they do something? What’s he going to do? What’s he going to say?
“LET ME TRANSLATE FOR YOU, KID! SHE’S TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT SHE WANTS TO FUCK YOU!”
Now, I could do something, but I’m tired and taking a break — plus, I easily see this for what it is: a set up and a trap. So, I just sit there and wheelchair pushes ass, disappearing back into the store. The couple laugh it off, but are embarrassed and leave.
Nearby, these two guys are talking about it under their breath and I figure why let the surreal times end?
“That was pretty odd wasn’t it?”
“Yeah,”the one facing me responds “what was that?”
“It’s a bit like street theater, confrontational theater, no?”
“Yes!”
“That’s because it is. This was just one of a few different scenes we’ve rehearsed. I’m the director of this project and we’ve just started live performances to gauge audience reactions.”
“Really?!”
“No.”
Then everybody laughed. This hot model chick walked on over and we French kissed. The mayor presented me with the key to the city, and I went inside and got a refill.
Okay, fine.
Only one of these things actually happened.
April Foooooools!
