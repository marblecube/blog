The Happy Meal Revelation
by Vidal Palacios


The man was 43 years old. He had a mortgage (well, technically, his bank did). 
He had a gym membership (which he hadn't used in seven months). He had a 
favorite brand of coffee (whichever was on sale that week). He was, by all 
accounts, a fully functioning adult—or at least, that’s what he told himself
every morning while adjusting his algorithm-approved dopamine intake.

And yet…

There it was.

A Happy Meal.

In his hand.

How?

He didn’t remember ordering a Happy Meal. He certainly didn’t remember wanting
a Happy Meal. He hadn't even been inside a McDonald's in years —not since they
stopped calling them "Supersize" and started pretending fries could be “healthy.”

And yet, here it was. Red box. Golden arches. Smell of deep-fried compliance.

And the worst part?

Half the fries were already gone.

He stared at the box like it was an ancient artifact, as if somewhere between
the plastic toy and the overly cheerful graphic design, it might contain the
answer to all of life’s mysteries. But there was nothing. Just a hollow void
where free will once lived.

Somewhere, a marketing executive smiled.

Somewhere, an algorithm adjusted.

Somewhere, his own brain betrayed him with a dopamine hit, just for looking at
the little, sealed plastic bag of apple slices.

He checked his phone, hoping for answers. Maybe he had blacked out. Maybe
there was some deep conspiracy. Maybe—

AD: "New! Limited-Time Grimace Shake! Try it before it’s gone!"

He closed the app. No help there.

His eyes flicked back to the Happy Meal, sitting on his lap like some kind of
neon-lit existential crisis.

What was this? What did it mean? Was he really in control?

Had he ever been?

A drop of sweat rolled down his forehead. The plastic straw of his Choco Milk™
stared back at him, unwavering.

The universe was silent. The world watched.

And then came The Voice.

From nowhere.
From everywhere.
From the deepest recesses of his own consumer-conditioned mind.

It whispered...

"Well, what ya gonna do, PLAYAH?!

You gonna throw it in the trash?

Or finish your nuggets, apple slices, and Choco Milk like the lil’ beeyotch
that ya are?!"

And in that moment, he knew.

There was no escape.

He hadn’t ordered the Happy Meal.

The Happy Meal had ordered him.

He had become a Mc Asshole.

He began chewing.
